*Conflict Plan*

As we all know project 'week' can be stressful. Our groups primary mechanism for addressing conflict is to have clear expectations of each group member in advance. We are using a psuedo sprint planning method to ensure that everyone knows what everyone else is doing and when it is expected to be done. In the event that the conflict is of a more personal nature and not just based around the work we will default to treating each other with respect and if necessary physically separate so that the people having an issue are not forced to work directly adjacent to each other. 

In the event that someone misses a deadline the groups goal is to be overall supportive and focused on resolving the situation rather than attacking a person. Should we as a group decide by general consensus (3/4) come to agree that one person is not pulling their weight we will have an open and direct conversation with them about what they want their contribution to the project to be. If possible we will shift priorities of other team members so that we are all contributing equally to a project that we all feel good about. Failing that we will escalate to Jeff after carefully weighing the situation.

For conflicts of scope or other deliverables (ie the direction of the project) we have a simple system based on prioritizing the MVP before features outside that scope and after MVP everyone has quite a bit of freedom to pursue their own stretch goals. The nature of this project lends itself very easily to stretch goals so getting quorum for MVP is easy since everyone is exccited about slightly different stretch goals. 


*Communication Plan*


After hours and over the weekend communication will be done via slack. This is a method of communication we are all familiar with and provides us the easy opportunity to 'opt out' of communication if needed. This means that we do not need to worry about texting too late, or other personal concerns which can be troublesome when people with different schedules collaborate.

On our meeting times the strategy for ensuring everyone is heard is a semi formal stand-up. We start with a code merge ensuring we are all sharing the latest of each others good code, we take time to explain what new parts we have each added and test it together to make sure that it is in good working order. After that we do a quick 'what are we working on today' and try to identify potential blockers for each other and if one person has expertise with something going on with the others we know what each other are doing so we can lend a hand. 

Creating a safe environment so that everyone feels comfortable speaking up is a proactive effort. We will make time for each person during our daily stand-ups and a when needed we will make additional time during team working time. 

*Project Scope*


---MVP--- 
A Clean functioning choose your own adventure story where the user can either 'die' or 'win' depending on the choices they make. This will have images and backend logic to enhance the text representation of the scenes being built. MVP goal is for 5 minutes of playtime (depending on reading speed)

---Stretch Goals---
Working HP/armor bar that shows damage to the character in real time
Visual display of items the character is holding or has access to
Longer run time (10 minutes run time depending on reading speed)
More interactive/visual battles
